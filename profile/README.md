# PSFT Group

The Plasma Science and Fusion Technology (PSFT) Group at the University of Seville aims at making fusion energy a reality for our society. A clean, sustainable and virtually unlimited energy source makes fusion the scientific and engineering challenge of the 21st century.

The PSFT group seeks to answer some of the most important questions on the fusion energy quest. Based on cutting-edge technologies and state-of-the-art numerical codes, we aim at getting a better understanding of energetic particle and plasma edge physics; key areas in the development of a high confinement, self maintained burning plasma. The development of new diagnostics and experimental approaches for the most relevant experimental fusion reactors worldwide form the basis of our research. The PSFT research mission is completed with the training of the new generation of fusion scientists and engineers.

## The SMall Aspect Ratio Tokamak - SMART

Spherical tokamaks (STs) [1,2] constitute an attractive path to a fusion reactor or volumetric neutron source due to their high-power densities at relatively modest costs and dimensions. The high-power densities achievable in STs pose, however, even more severe constraints on their plasma facing components (PFCs) than those observed in conventional tokamaks. Alternative power and particle exhaust techniques are, thus, mandatory for a ST-based fusion power plant (FPP) [3].

Recent experiments at the TCV and DIII-D conventional tokamaks have shown that Negative Triangularity (NT) shaped L-mode plasmas can feature H-mode like confinement factors with attractive power exhaust properties [4]–[10]. Interestingly, in conventional tokamaks, NT shaped L-mode plasmas show H-mode like confinement factors with:

- Enhanced core thermal plasma confinement
- No edge pedestal and thus, no edge localised modes (ELMs)
- Broadening of escaping power and particle channel, i.e. wider exhaust footprint and reduced peak power on PFCs
- Divertor naturally placed at larger radii

### Mission

The SMall Aspect Ratio Tokamak (SMART), with R=0.4m, a=0.2m, Ip=500 kA, Bt<1T, pulse lengths up to 500 ms and neutral beam injection power of 1MW [11], aims at exploring high confinement NT-shaped plasmas in low aspect ratio tokamaks. The unique SMART plasma shaping capabilities makes this experiment a first-of-a-kind that will certainly break new ground on the road to a ST-based FPP [12]–[14].

To achieve this, the Plasma Science and Fusion Technology (PSFT) team of the University of Seville operates the SMART tokamak with the following goals:

- High confinement regimes in negative and positive triangularity plasmas. A first-of-a-kind in STs.
- Energetic particles and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability.
- Edge physics and plasma wall interaction.
- Innovative power exhaust techniques.
- Advanced real time control techniques.
- Training of fusion engineers and physicists.
- Contribute to key scientific and technological challenges towards a fusion power plant.
